What does a VM do?
Accepts money from a customer and dispenses selected food/drink to the customer.  Then dispenses change, if any.

What is the sequence or workflow of a vending machine?


  1. user walks up to the vm to look at the available items.
  2. the available items are displayed to the user with an id and a price
  3. the user inserts money into the machine and enters the id to purchase
  4. if the amount entered is greater than or equal to the price of the entered item, the machine dispenses the item to the user.
  5. if there is any change left, the machine calculates the fewest amount of coins to return and dispenses the change.
  6. if the amount entered is less than the price of the selected item, display message that the price is x, y was entered and z remains.
